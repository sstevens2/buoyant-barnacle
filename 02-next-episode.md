:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you write a lesson using RMarkdown and `{sandpaper}`?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain how to use markdown with the new lesson template
- Demonstrate how to include pieces of code, figures, and nested challenge blocks

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This is the new Carpentries template. It is written in [RMarkdown][r-markdown],
which is a variant of Markdown that allows you to render code inside the
lesson. Please refer to the [lesson
example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three block quotes required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?


```r
paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 

```{.output}
[1] "This new template looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 3 : testing if I can make challenges?

What libraries do you have loaded?
Try using `sessionInfo()` to find out

::::::::::::::::::::::: solution


```r
sessionInfo()
```

```{.output}

## Figures

You can also include figures:


```r
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.Rmd` files for lessons even if you don't need to generate any code
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
